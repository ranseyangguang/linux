	  ARC Linux can run on ARC Instruction set Simulator.
	  The binary built for AA4/ML509 can run on ISS, despite lack of
	  peripherals since drivers check if they are on ISS vs. real H/w.
	  This config option is only used if you want to build ISS specific
	  virtual periperal drivers such as virt-framebuffer or virt-mac.
