 * vineetg: May 2011
 *  -Folded PAGE_PRESENT (used by VM) and PAGE_VALID (used by MMU) into 1.
 *     They are semantically the same although in different contexts
 *     VALID marks a TLB entry exists and it will only happen if PRESENT
 *  - Utilise some unused free bits to confine PTE flags to 12 bits
 *     This is a must for 4k pg-sz
 *
 * vineetg: Mar 2011 - changes to accomodate MMU TLB Page Descriptor mods
 *  -TLB Locking never really existed, except for initial specs
 *  -SILENT_xxx not needed for our port
 *  -Per my request, MMU V3 changes the layout of some of the bits
 *     to avoid a few shifts in TLB Miss handlers.

 *
 * Other rules which cause the divergence from 1:1 mapping
 *
 *  1. Although ARC700 can do exclusive execute/write protection (meaning R
 *     can be tracked independet of X/W unlike some other CPUs), still to
 *     keep things consistent with other archs:
 *      -Write implies Read:   W => R
 *      -Execute implies Read: X => R
 *
 *  2. Pvt Writable doesn't have Write Enabled initially: Pvt-W => !W
 *     This is to enable COW mechanism
