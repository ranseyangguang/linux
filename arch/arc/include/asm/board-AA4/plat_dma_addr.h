/* Some notes on DMA <=> kernel address generation
 *
 * A simplistic implementation will generate 0 based bus address.
 * For e.g. 0x8AAA_0000 becomes 0x0AAA_0000 bus addr
 * However this doesnt work with PCI devices behind the PCI Host Bridge on AA4
 * which can't allow 0 based addresses. So the API for special case of PCI
 * makes corrections
 *
 * As a small optimisation, if PCI is not enabled we can simply return
 * 0 based bus addr hence the CONFIG_xx check for PCI Host Bridge
