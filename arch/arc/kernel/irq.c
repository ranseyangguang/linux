 * arch_local_irq_enable - Enable interrupts.
 *
 * 1. Explicitly called to re-enable interrupts
 * 2. Implicitly called from spin_unlock_irq, write_unlock_irq etc
 *    which maybe in hard ISR itself
 *
 * Semantics of this function change depending on where it is called from:
 *
 * -If called from hard-ISR, it must not invert interrupt priorities
 *  e.g. suppose TIMER is high priority (Level 2) IRQ
 *    Time hard-ISR, timer_interrupt( ) calls spin_unlock_irq several times.
 *    Here local_irq_enable( ) shd not re-enable lower priority interrupts
 * -If called from soft-ISR, it must re-enable all interrupts
 *    soft ISR are low prioity jobs which can be very slow, thus all IRQs
 *    must be enabled while they run.
 *    Now hardware context wise we may still be in L2 ISR (not done rtie)
 *    still we must re-enable both L1 and L2 IRQs
 *  Another twist is prev scenario with flow being
 *     L1 ISR ==> interrupted by L2 ISR  ==> L2 soft ISR
 *     here we must not re-enable Ll as prev Ll Interrupt's h/w context will get
 *     over-written (this is deficiency in ARC700 Interrupt mechanism)
