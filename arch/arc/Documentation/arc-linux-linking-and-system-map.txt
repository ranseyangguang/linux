SDRAM/DDR Placement in System Memory Map when running ARC Linux
===============================================================

For ARC700, the 32 bit address space (4G) is split as 2G:2G. This is defined
with PAGE_OFFSET "the universal kernel constant" which remains unchanged.

-The lower 2G (0 to 0x7FFF_FFFF) is translated by MMU and thus suitable for
    implementing user address space.
-The upper 2G (0x8000_0000 to 0xFFFF_FFFF) is not translated and is implicitly
    available in each task's address space - thus suitable for kernel code/data
    which is why ARC Linux by default is linked at 0x8000_0000;
    all kernel logical addresses (in objdump/readelf) are 0x8zs based.

From a board designer's perspective this implies wiring the SDRAM/DDR
at high-address 0x8000_0000. However certain boards could have peripherals
(e.g. framebuffer RAM) wired there. Thus kernel image base != PAGE_OFFSET.
To address this, there's a config option, CONFIG_LINUX_LINK_BASE.
It trickles to linker-map file "arch/arc/vmlinux.lds.S" and also all
page frame acounting is based on it (as opposed to PAGE_OFFSET).

While CONFIG_LINUX_LINK_BASE indicates start of external RAM wiring,
CONFIG_SDRAM_SIZE captures the RAM size (again used primarlily by page frame
accounting)
